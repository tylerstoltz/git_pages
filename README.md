# Claude Code Monorepo

This is a monorepo containing standalone projects created and managed by Claude Code.

## Structure

Each project lives in its own directory with:
- Independent dependencies and configuration
- Its own README.md with project-specific details
- Separate version control and documentation

## Getting Started

1. Browse the project directories to find what you're looking for
2. Each project directory contains its own README.md with setup instructions
3. Follow the project-specific guidelines for development and testing

## Contributing

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for:
- Development environment details
- Available languages and tools
- Testing guidelines
- Pull request conventions

## Guidelines

- Create new project directories for new initiatives
- Keep projects independent and self-contained
- Document each project thoroughly in its own README.md
- When in doubt, create a new project rather than modifying existing ones
